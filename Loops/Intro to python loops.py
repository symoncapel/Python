# for-in loop you tell it how many times to run
    #That is a very nice thing about for in loops because you as a developer you don't have to keep track or even know how many items are in a list in a tuple or in a dictionary you can simply iterate over it. If there is one it will go through it one time, if there are 5,000 you'll go through 5,000 times.


# while loop you tell it when to stop 
    #a while loop is very different. It's a little bit more low level it's not quite as intelligent as a for-in loop a while loop will continue as many times as you want it to go. So in other words, if we have 250 gumballs in here and I set a while loop to perform this task. And I don't tell the while loop when to stop even after I've gone through and I've spun the knob 250 times the while loop will keep ongoing. It will do it a thousand times 2000 times they'll keep on going and in fact, if you don't implement a while loop properly then you will run into what's called an infinite loop where the program will never stop and eventually the computer or the server will just crash. What you have to do when working with a while loop is you as a developer need to actually tell it when to stop.
